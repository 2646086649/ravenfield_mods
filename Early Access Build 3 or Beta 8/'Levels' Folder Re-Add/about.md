A mod for EA3 which adds the "levels" folder back. Useful for maps not on the workshop or if you want to play maps on the go (no Steam Access). Also creates the levels folder if it does not exsist unlike the normal levels folder.

Future plans would be to allow images to be loaded but it might not come...
