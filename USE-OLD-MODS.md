# Download older versions of Ravenfield
Do you want to try out older mods for older versions of Ravenfield? This is how:

For pre-steam go to here:
Beta 5: https://steelraven7.itch.io/ravenfield
Beta 1-4: https://steelraven7.itch.io/ravenfield-beta-3-old-game-version?secret=C2Jwn6nFFBVNLANgtJGGx3OF4

For steam (most likely what you want) you need to follow several steps:

    1. Open steam in with the console tab. To do this type this into a browser: steam://nav/console.
    2. Choose the platform you want to download for (remember this code for later):
      Windows 64bit: 636481
      Windows 32bit: 636482
      Mac: 636483
      Linux: 636484
    3. Type in https://steamdb.info/depot/(platform id number)/manifests/ in a browser
    4. Find the version you want to download and copy the manifest id number.
    5. Steam should be open, make sure you're on the new "Console" tab.
    6. In the input box at the bottom type without quotations: "download_depot 636480 (platform id number) (manifest id number)" (you may need to run a second time if there are missing files).
    7. Wait for it to download and steam will open the download location once it's done. 
    8. Copy the files.
    9. Got to library, Ravenfield, properties, local files and paste the files into the Ravenfield directory.
    10. You're done! To go back, force update Ravenfield and it will be back to normal.
