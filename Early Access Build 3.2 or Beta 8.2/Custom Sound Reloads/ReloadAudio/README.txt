This is where the reload audio goes.

The RK-44.wav file that comes with this folder is an example of how you'd name files.

The names are as follows, with the required audio type being .wav:

RK-44
S-IND7
S-IND7 [SUP]
SIGNAL DMRddddd
SL-DEFENDER
76 EAGLE
DAGGER
FRAG
QUICKSILVER
N.V GOGGLES
RECON LRR
SPEARHEAD
HYDRA
SCALPEL
WRENCH
.357 CONDOR
AMMO BAG
MEDIC BAG
SLAM-R
AIR HORN
PATRIOT
HMG

So for example, to create an HMG reload audio, make a sound, export it as wav, and then put it in this folder, naming it HMG.wav.
